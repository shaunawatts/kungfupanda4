                I am currently a full time student at Brigham Young University. 
                As a sophmore, I'm taking classes to prepare me to major in ... 
                I've chosen this program because I like stuff. This is a boring 
                vision statement so you probably won't be interesting in hiring 
                me as an intern or for full time employment. Rather, pretend I 
                put a lot of time and effort into creating this statement. Pretend 
                my writing style is creative and compelling and that my grammar 
                is flawless. For example, pretend I wrote "interested" instead of 
                "interesting" in the fourth sentence.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is probably long enough, but I'm a "go-getter" so I'll
                ramble on a little more. Some people take a long time to say
                absolutely nothing. But not me. Therefore, I'm going to summarize
                my educational goals in fancy bullet points below. You're welcome!
            </p>
